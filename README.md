This repository contains the complementary files referred to in the paper "**An Automated Multi-Layered Methodology to Assist the Secure and Risk-Aware Design of Multi-Factor Authentication Protocols**", submitted to the *IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing* Journal.

In Section 4, we have applied our methodology to a concrete authentication protocol that we have designed. In particular, for the symbolic analysis, we have modelled the protocol through the specification language **ASLan++**, a high-level language that formalizes the interactions between the different protocol roles. The model has then been given in input to **SATMC** (SAT-based Model Checker), an open and flexible platform for model-checking security protocols via reduction to SAT.

Thereby, this repository contains ASLan++ file and analyses outputs.
